We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature.
                Nature comprises of the connection between the life species, their habitat, their activities, living conditions and survival process. Biodiversity is measured higher in the tropical and floristic regions. The best studied species are mostly the large mammals. The diversity in nature cannot be measured in figures but all the living species large or tiny have an important role to play in nature. Biodiversity is responsible for balanced ecosystem. The spread of biodiversity varies across the globe depending on the soil, temperature, rainfall, altitude and geography.The serenity of nature calms our hearts. The stillness and movement in nature both have a hypnotizing effect. The unfolding creativity of nature is an art. It is alluring to experience solitude with nature.

                <p>Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.
                    Natural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms. 
                    Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth.
                    The most interesting fact about nature is the diversity of nature. It is the true beauty of nature. The diversity in nature has important role to play in the lifecycle on earth. The variety of life species on the earth is known as biodiversity of nature. It refers to the diversity of plants, animals, organisms, birds, bees etc. It also includes small microorganisms, fungi, algae, bacteria and many other insects and tiny creatures. It encompasses the diverse nature of ecosystem such as forests, desserts, mountains, rainforests and oceans. All are these are a part of nature.
                    Nature comprises of the connection between the life species, their habitat, their activities, living conditions and survival process. Biodiversity is measured higher in the tropical and floristic regions. The best studied species are mostly the large mammals. The diversity in nature cannot be measured in figures but all the living species large or tiny have an important role to play in nature.
